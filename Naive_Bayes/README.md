# Naive Bayes Classifier - Sentiment Analysis 

- This is the implementation of Naive Bayes classifier specifically for sentiment analysis.  
- The implementation works with text data only.  
- Features are unigrams with binary values (1 for appearance in the text, 0 otherwise)

## Data
- Dataset name: Large movie review dataset v1.0
- Author: Maas, Andrew L.  and  Daly, Raymond E.  and  Pham, Peter T.  and  Huang, Dan  and  Ng, Andrew Y.  and  Potts, Christopher
- source: IMDB

## In this folder
- Naive Bayes classifier implementation (as a class object in Python)
- main.py: parse the data and test the implementation with the dataset
- Movie review dataset
- Visualization: my attempt in visualizing the trained model in a meaningful way that yield (not the high frequency words, but the) meaningful words that can be used to differentiate positive and negative sentiment
